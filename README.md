# ascii-breakout

ascii-breakout is a game inspired by Atari's 1976 classic, _Breakout_.
It uses text-based graphics and can be played in a terminal.

I originally wrote this in 2020 for my final portfolio project in AP
Computer Science Principles, when I was in 11th grade. Since then, I've
sanded off a few rough edges: wrote this README, refactored, improved
documentation, etc.

## Build

```
git clone https://git.sr.ht/~smlavine/ascii-breakout
